title: "Visualizing Garmin GPS Data"
date: 2019-06-11

				  The goal of this project was to explore my running, cycling and swimming data from the past 5 years.
				 Applications like Strava and Garmin Connect provide good tools for visualizing training data over 
				 short periods of time but aren't good for looking at how your training has changed over the course of years.
				 This project is an attempt to fill that gap.
				 
				  I started running in 2009 when I joined my high school’s cross-country team but it wasn’t until June of 
				 2014 that I got my first GPS watch and began recording my runs. I wanted to get an in-depth picture of my
				 running habits and my dive into triathlons. The data for this article was downloaded from my Garmin 
				 Connect account. The charts in this article were created with R and ggplot2, if you are interested in the
				 code used to generate the visualization in this article please visit my [github page](https://github.com/edeaster/Garmin-Visualization)
