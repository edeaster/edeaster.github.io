            <h3> Hi, I'm Elizabeth </h3>
                <p> I graduated from North Carolina State University with a B.S. Material Science and Engineering in 2017. I currently work 
				at biotech startup, Clinical Sensors in RTP, NC. I made this website to post the side projects I've been working on. You can reach me
